	<h2>My time at Cerritos College</h2>
	<p>I began going to Cerritos in the Fall of 2020. At first, I was enrolled at Compton College. However, due to many problems I personally had with the college, I stopped attending. After working different jobs for about two years, I decided to try pursuing a degree again. This time I chose to enroll at Cerritos College. Cerritos has been the most helpful when it comes to keeping me informed of my progress and when it comes to planning out my classes. </p>
