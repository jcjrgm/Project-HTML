	<h2>Welcome</h2>
		<p>I am Juan Chavez, a student at Cerritos College. I began going to Cerritos when the Fall semester began in 2020. I've been doing my best to achieve my Associate's in Programming and hopefully I'll be able to graduate by Spring 2022. Since I was a child, I enjoyed picking apart my video game handhelds. I was fascinated by the physical components but never understood how the game itself ran. As I grew older, I became more and more interested in programming and seeing how it works with the physical electronics.</p>
